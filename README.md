# PBI-Refresh

Ever wondered what’s happening under the covers when refreshing a Power BI dataset? Why is it taking so long? Can we make it run faster? Is there some sort of resource bottleneck I’m running into? How can I tell?

Refreshing a Power BI dataset can be a resource intensive workload and depending on your specific requirements (e.g. speed, availability, data volume, etc) it may not be feasible to process the entire model each time.

In this session, you’ll learn about…

- the internal data structures behind a dataset (including the difference between a regular and calculated column!)
- what happens and in what order when you refresh a dataset
- several common refresh strategies and the associated trade offs
- how monitor and detect common resource bottlenecks
